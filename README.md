# This is a folder contains every code that I used to develope the camera system
The main code is the main_detection.py. In order to use it user has to run the code within a cmd 
with 2 parameters: --port 8000 --ip 0.0.0.0
The IP of the camera in the code should be change according to the current cameras' IP addresses 
and there should be 2 cameras for the code to work properly. Otherwise you would have to change 
the code
This code utilises Yolov7, Flask, and OpenCV
